            I was born and raised in Chau Doc, a small town located on Mekong
            delta in the South of Vietnam, where you can find countless floating
            houses, tons of motorbikes on streets and endless green rice fields.
            I came to the USA in 2015 and graduated Summa Cum Laude with an
            Associateâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity in 2018. Right after finishing
            college, I went to Flatiron School, a coding bootcamp, to learn full
            stack web development. I graduated from the bootcamp in April 2019
            and have been working professionally as a software engineer since
            then. So far, I have contributed to two major projects (one for the
            Washington DC Government, one for the Federal Government) and many
            other projects. I am a lifelong learner who is always looking to
            acquiring new techinial expertise to add more values to my products.
